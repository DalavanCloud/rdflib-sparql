RDFLib-SPARQL
=============

A SPARQL 1.1 implementation for RDFLib

This replaces the old implementation available in RDFExtras, hopefully with more maintainable code.

Usage: 
------

Install with setuptools, either easy_install or pip will register the SPARQL processor with RDFLib automatically. I cannot recommend this strongly enough. 

(you should also uninstall rdfextras - although my test with both installed
still gave me the NEW sparql implementation - but I belive this was random, i.e. depending on a hash value of something)

Then query like you always would - see also ./examples

Property Paths
--------------

SPARQL PropertyPaths are also available as "pseudo properties" in python code. 
See ./examples/foafpath.py and docs in rdflib_sparql/paths.py 

Status: 
-------

Currently only SPARQL Query is supported. 

Currently about 90% of SPARQL 1.0 and SPARQL 1.1 pass. This should be much better than the RDFExtras implementation. 

So far, only functional testing has been done, i.e. performance may be rubbish. 

If you would like to dig into the code, see DEVELOPERS

I would welcome any feedback on this!
